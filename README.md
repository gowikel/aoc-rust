# Advent of Code - Rust

This repository holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I used them mainly to learn Rust, and to have some fun. The contents of this
repository are under the [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) license, meaning
that you can do whatever you want to it.

However, please, note that the puzzles and the puzzle input is licensed by Advent of
Code. Special considerations has been taken to avoid leaking the puzzle inputs. If
you need them, go to [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).
